# Welcome to 🇪🇺 EUROPA

This website is related to the **Europa CRO validator node**
You can find more information about the validator on this page, and useful links.

## What is a CRO validator?
Recently, [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com) start its own blockchain, a mainnet using the CRO token natively (it was originally an ERC-20 token from the Ethereum blockchain).
The blockchain is more detailed on the [Crypto.org website](https://crypto.org/), this blockchain rely on a **DPoS** (**Delegated Proof-of-Stake**) algorithm.

This way, anybody can participate easily:
* You don't need to be rich to participate and be rewarded. The minimal stake requirements is **1 CRO**!
* This is a **flexible** stake, there is no fixed terms, you can stake/unstake or more exactly delegate/un-delegate/re-delegate as you want (by performing a transaction on the CRO mainnet)
* You can start your own node (like I did) and setup your commission rules. And so, people can delegate to your validator.
* You can also delegate to another validator, check their commission rates, ...

## Which validator should I choose?
You can choose a validator on 3 criteria:
1. The commissions rates applied by this validator (you can find it using the CRO Validator list link below).
2. The trust you give the validator (if the validator goes offline, you will cease to receive rewards).
3. Do you want to delegate to the richest validators (that will probably not goes offline soon...), or do you prefer to delegate to a smaller one and contribute to the decentralization of this blockchain.

## How can I delegate some CRO to this validator?
For now you can use the Desktop Wallet from Crypto.com (still beta), but follow information as the staking will be available on the DeFi Wallet app on Android/iOS soon.
**Using the Staking features**, use the following Validator Address: **crocncl1f5tczesgrq4p0que3qadekk56z3k5nj4ktcupv**
> ⚠️ **WARNING:**
> You **MUST** use the Staking feature **ONLY**. Do **NOT** try to send CRO directly on the validator address!

## Where the EUROPA validator is hosted?
To be 100% transparent, I currently use a [Contabo](https://contabo.com/en/) VPS "VPS XL SSD" located in Germany.
**Contabo is a german hosting vps/server provider**, which offers VPS at an exceptional price considering the SSD space, CPU and RAM they offer.
The servers do not offer the fastest SSDs, but are sufficient today for a CRO validator.
